 # DOS Shell in C++

## Introduction
This is a C++ implementation of a simple DOS shell that allows users to navigate through a file system, create and delete files and folders, and view file attributes. The shell uses a tree data structure to represent the file system and provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

## Implementation Details
### 1. File Class
The `File` class represents a single file in the file system. It contains attributes such as the file name, path, number of lines and characters, average number of lines, read-only and hidden flags, creation time, owner, and file type. The class also includes a method to print the file attributes.

```cpp
class File {
public:
    string name;
    string path;
    int noOflines;
    int noOfchar;
    int avgNoOflines;
    bool readonly;
    bool hidden;
    time_t creationTime;
    string owner;
    string fileType;
    time_t timeToPrint;

public:
    File(string fileName="null", string filePath="", string extension="", string Owner="")
    {
        name = fileName;
        path = filePath;
        fileType = extension;
        readonly = false;
        hidden = false;
        owner = Owner;
    }

    void PrintAttribute()
    {
        cout << "File Name:" << name << endl;
        cout << "File Path:" << path << endl;
        cout << "File Owner:" << owner << endl;
        cout << "File Type:" << fileType << endl;
        cout << "Hidden:" << (hidden ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
        cout << "Read-Only:" << (readonly ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;    
    }
};
```

### 2. Folder Class
The `Folder` class represents a directory in the file system. It contains attributes such as the folder name, parent folder, hidden flag, owner, path, creation time, and a list of subfolders and files. The class also includes methods to add and remove files and folders, print the directory contents, and find files and folders by name.

```cpp
class Folder {
public:
    string name;
    Folder* Parent;
    bool hidden;
    string owner;
    string path;
